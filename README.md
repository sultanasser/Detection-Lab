# Detection-Lab

## Ojbective
### Brief Description of the project
The Detection Lab project aims to establish a controlled environment for simulating and detecting cyber attack. The primary focus was to ingest and analyze logs within a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system, generating test telemetry to mimic real-world attack scenarios.
This hannds-on experience was designed to deepen understanding of network security, attack patterns, and defensive strategies.

### Skills Learned
- Advanced understanding of SIEM concepts and practical application.
- Proficiency in analyzing and interpreting network logs.
- Ability to generate and recognize attack signatures and patterns.
- Enhanced knowledge of network protocols and security vulnerabilities.
- Development of critical thinking and problem solving skills in cybersecurity.

### Tools Used
- A. Splunk SIEM system for log ingestion and analysis
- B. Network analysis tools (such as wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic
- C. 
- D.
